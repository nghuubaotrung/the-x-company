[The Idea](http://the-x-company.surge.sh/)

This branch contains the source code of xWallet, a customized crypto currency wallet for the project "The X Company".
We decided to create our own crypto wallet since we need a customized solution to help us with our transactions and a better way to monitoring multi-balances.

The prototype system of xWallet contains 2 servers, one for Geth CLI and Mining tasks, one for front-end application which was built using Meteor framework (NodeJS).
We also using MongoDB as 1 centralized DB (for performance-experiment purpose only)
